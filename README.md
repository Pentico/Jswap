# Jswap

A Website where students can have an E-garage sell. 

### Prerequisites

Node.js
MongoDB


## Recommended Node.js Libraries

- [Nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) - Automatically restart Node.js server on code changes.
- [geoip-lite](https://github.com/bluesmoon/node-geoip) - Geolocation coordinates from IP address.
- [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) - Front End FrameWork.

## Deployment

The easiest way to get started is to clone the repository:
```
 # Get the latest snapshot
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/Pentico/Jswap.git myproject

# Change directory
cd myproject

# Install NPM dependencies
npm install

# Or, if you prefer to use `yarn` instead of `npm`
yarn install

# Then simply start your app
node app.js
 ```
 
 Note: I highly recommend installing Nodemon. It watches for any changes in your node.js app and automatically restarts
 the server. Once installed, instead of node app.js use nodemon app.js. It will save you a lot of time in the long run, 
 because you won't need to manually restart the server each time you make a small change in code. To install,
 run ``` sudo npm install -g nodemon``` .
